## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "How long until I see results?"
SEO takes 3-6 months to show significant results. However, you may start seeing traffic within 30 days for low-competition keywords.

### "Do I need to change anything on the website?"
No, the website is ready to go. Just upload the files and start promoting it.
